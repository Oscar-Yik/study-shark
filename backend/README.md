### run on first time opening the program:
$ npm install

### start app:
$ npm start

### initialize db:
$ npm run init-db

For the program to work, you need to create a .env file with:
DB='<database name>' // i named mines 'cpsc304' you can call it whatever it doesnt matter
DB_PW='<database password>'

Have fun~
